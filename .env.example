# Client environment variables for development

# API Server runs on port 4001
# Client runs on port 3001

# Set this to your server's IP if auto-detection doesn't work
# Example: VITE_API_URL=http://192.168.1.100:4001
# Note: if app runs on localhost and API is an IP (or vice versa), auth cookies may be rejected.
# Keep VITE_API_URL empty for auto-detection in most local setups.
